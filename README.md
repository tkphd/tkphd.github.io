# Trevor Keller's Portfolio

This site is built on [Artist's Theme], an exemplary professional portfolio
designed by [Travis Neilson] in a [YouTube series], one week at a time.
It has been modified from the original to reflect my professional activities.

## How to install/use

In order to get this super fantastic [Jekyll] powered template for Artists
follow this simple step:

* If you haven't got ruby installed on your computer, install it.
* Then run in your terminal `$ gem install jekyll`
* Move/`cd` to a folder, always in your terminal, in which you want to
  insert the *Artists-Theme*
* Run `git clone https://github.com/DevTips/Artists-Theme.git`
* Then `cd Artists-Theme`
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* Write your details into `_data/settings.yml` -- especially the
  [Microanalytics] ID!
* Change the top-level **CNAME**
* **DONE**
