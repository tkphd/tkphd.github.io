# Trevor Keller's Portfolio

This site is built on [Artist's Theme](https://devtips.github.io/Artists-Theme/),
an exemplary professional portfolio designed by [Travis Neilson](https://www.youtube.com/DevTipsForDesigners)
in a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI),
one week at a time.
It has been modified from the original to reflect my professional activities.
