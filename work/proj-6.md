title: Sourdough Stuff

Sourdough is an amazing ecosystem, with symbiotic yeast and lactobacteria
feeding off of the protein and starch in whole grain flour. These organisms
break down some parts of the wheat kernel humans have difficulty digesting,
and produce a bread with appealing texture and complex flavors.
