title: Multiphase Stuff
---

Phase-field models intended for grain growth can assign one phase field variable
to each phase or subdomain of the system. If the free energy is not carefully
chosen, however, so-called "spurious" phase can nucleate or diffuse into the
triple junctions. These numerical artifacts have no basis in thermodynamics,
and adversely affect the system's coarsening kinetics.
